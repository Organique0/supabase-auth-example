This is the result of me trying to implement an auth feature on my own.

It did not go well.

This is why people use Clerk.

So much easier.

Can someone help me improve this?

There is some leftover code since this was supposed to be a different project.


*********************************************************************
UPDATE: I think that it works pretty well now. 

But since I have now proven that I know how to do this. I am going back to Clerk.
